Description: Learned Pattern Similarity (LPS) for time series. 
			Implements a novel approach to model the dependency structure 
			in time series that generalizes the concept of autoregression to local 
			auto-patterns. Generates a pattern-based representation of time series
			along with a similarity measure called Learned Pattern Similarity (LPS).
			Introduces a generalized autoregressive kernel.This package is based on the 
			'randomForest' package by Andy Liaw.
